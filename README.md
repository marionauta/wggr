# wggr

_(pronounced wagger) â€” **W**atch **G**ame **GR**aphics_

A set of functions to ease drawing colors, rectangles, sprites and text onto a
[`CGContext`][cgcontext]. This library contains bindings to some of Apple's Core
Graphics framework functions. This library also contains easier to use functions
that match the [`raylib`][raylib] API. This library is not intended to be a
replacement of either Core Graphics nor raylib.
